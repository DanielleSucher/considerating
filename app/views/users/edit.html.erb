	<p>Josh, this is a page just for you! If you ban a user, 
	their account will remain, and they'll still be able
	to vote, but they won't be able to post any new considerations and
	all their old considerations will be deleted.
	I'm having you tag users as banned rather than destroy
	their accounts, because if you just destroyed a user's account,
	that user could just go ahead and create a new account by
	logging in through twitter again. This way, their twitter account
	is stuck as banned. It makes sense, really. Just go ahead and
	click the Ban button if you're serious about it.</p>
